# NYC-Transit-and-Limousine-Comission-Project-
Welcome to my New York City Transit and Limousine Commission (TLC) Project!
## Introduction
I am thrilled to unveil my Project Proposal and Project Planning Strategy document, highlighting my contributions to the New York City Transit and Limousine Commission (TLC) Project! Automatidata, a fictitious company, has been entrusted by the New York City TLC to develop a predictive model for fare price generation. This project served as a crucial component of my coursework for the Advanced Google Data Analytics Certification Course, "Foundations of Data Science." It is important to note that the dataset used was specifically designed for educational purposes.
## About the Project
The primary objective is to create a Project Proposal that focuses on organizing tasks into milestones, following the PACE workflow (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) as taught in the Foundations of Data Science course, and identifying key stakeholders. Additionally, the proposal  includes a timeline outlining the estimated duration for each Data Analysis activity. Join me in this endeavor as we delve into the world of Data Analysis!
## Sharing and Collaboration
As I share the Project Proposal and the PACE strategy document, my goal is not only to showcase my capabilities as a Data Analytics professional but also to inspire others in their Data Analysis journey. I invite you to explore the techniques and strategies presented in these documents. Your feedback, discussions, and collaboration are highly encouraged as they contribute to fostering a constructive and collaborative learning environment. Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository and engage with my work. I hope you find it insightful and valuable!
## Acknowledgements
I am sincerely grateful to Google for offering the "Foundations in Data Science" course, which has been instrumental in equipping me with essential knowledge in the field. This comprehensive course not only taught me the fundamentals of Data Science, but also provided valuable guidance on writing effective project proposals and navigating the necessary steps to successfully complete a Data Science project.
